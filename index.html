   <h2>Keyboards</h2>
   <p>So keyboards are amazing, right? The best interface between human and machine. Precise, fast, intuitive...elegant. But they are fundementally broken, from the layout, to the materials, to the ergonomics. It seems that whoever designed the modern keyboard never wanted any sane person to use it. This only speaks to the versility and awesomeness of keyboards, though. To be so broken but still be so widely used by so many people.</p>
