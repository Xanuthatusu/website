            <h3>About</h3>
            <span>I am a 18 year old software developer currently attending school at DSU in St. George, Utah. I just graduated high school from the SUCCESS Academy at DSU with my Associates Degree.

   <h2>Keyboards</h2>
   <p>So keyboards are amazing, right? The best interface between human and machine. Precise, fast, intuitive...elegant. But they are fundementally broken, from the layout, to the materials, to the ergonomics. It seems that whoever designed the modern keyboard never wanted any sane person to use it. This only speaks to the versility and awesomeness of keyboards, though. To be so broken but still be so widely used by so many people.</p>


   <h2>Rant/Opinion Corner</h2>
   <span>I don't like capitalism. I know that makes me sound like a lazy millennial who romanticizes communism and wishes Joseph Stalin is still in power. I promise I'm not. I do realize that I sound like a hippie when I say this, but I feel like the way society treats consumers is sickening. I'm constantly bombarded with messages about the next cheap item I can buy that will enhance my life in every way. It's all lies and bullshit. Just tricks to get me to spend my money on something I don't need or want to impress people I don't care about. Now, I'm not totally anti-capitalism/corporations/consumerism. I do buy expensive stuff that I like, sometimes to impress people. But I still think it's an awful way to live my life. If your only motivating factor in life is materialistic, I can't see how you would be able to live a happy life. I am trying to find happiness, and I honestly think the best way to do that is Buddhism. I don't like getting all religious on the internet because I know that it comes off super bad. I know I am no better than whoever is reading this. I'm not trying to convert you to Buddhism or do I think it is the best answer for everybody. I'm just putting down all my thoughts and reasons for how I live my life. Anyway, Buddhism tells me that I should be able to let go of these materialistic ideas and strive towards things that really make me happy. I don't want to be an office jockey working 40 hours a week going nowhere in life because that's what society expects of me. I don't want to wake up on my 40th birthday and realize I've wasted most of my life not doing what I want. I'm going to travel the world and engage with people and things that most people think they would never be able to do in a million years. You only think that because that's what your boss has told you. Sure, you might lose your job if you don't work for 2 years while you go and enjoy yourself, but so what? Get another job! What do you think you'd regret more? Not leaving your job that you only sort of like to go fulfill your dreams? or staying in a mediocre career with no stories or interesting stories to tell or reflect on.</span>
