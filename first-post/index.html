          This site was heavily inspired by the <a href="http://mnmlist.com/">mnmlist</a> website created by Leo Babauta. By "heavily inspired" I mean I stumbled upon their site by chance one day, liked the way it looked, and pretty much copied it with the intent of writing my own minimalist blog posts, just not about minimalism.

        <p>
          Right now, the site is running on one html and one css file, but I'd like to take the time to add in some more functionality. Perhaps using a database to store these entries so I can back them up and archive them.
        </p>

          I'm not really sure what I want to do with this just yet, but I know that if I didn't take the time to actually build this thing, it would never get done.

        Until I actually get some things put up here, check out my <a href="https://github.com/xanuthatusu/">github</a> or feel free to email me at anthony@tepia.net.
