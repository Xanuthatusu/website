          Time is a funny thing. All my life I've been aware of how little time each of us have on this small rock, and I've always tried my hardest to make the most of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because of this, I've always rushed through everything so that I can get to reaping the rewards of my work. That's not to say I didn't enjoy the journey, but I never took the time to sit back and just be happy with where I am.
        </p>
        <p>
          In fact, being happy with where I am was something I actively avoided for a very long time because I was and &#8212 to an extent &#8212 still am quite afriad of stagnation.
        </p>
        <p>
        And while doing this all day, everyday has led to me being able to feel successful financially and in my work, I found that I was always thinking about and planning for the future, and never enjoying the present. When I would have any free time, I'd open up my <a href="">budgeting app</a> and plan what my next several paychecks would go to.
        </p>
        <p>
          I found myself neglecting the world in front of me in favour of imagining the world ahead of me. My day to day life consisted of doing the necessary work to get where I was wanting and then just waiting. Killing time knowing that even my most current plans were weeks or months away.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then I started giving up my hobbies and things I enjoyed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why take the time to practice and learn the guitar, play video games with friends, or even mess around with my keyboards when I can be planning for the future. I would much rather pass my time by calculating how long it would take for me to reach my emergency savings goal and then see if I can afford to put more money towards that by sacrificing another category.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would do this planning for hours almost everyday.
        </p>
        <p>
          And I thought I was doing the right thing because I <a href="">felt like an adult</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Planning for the future is all well and good, but not if you lose sight of what you love and enjoy doing. Don't become obssessed with the future to the point you lose the present. Enjoy your life, every single moment of it.
