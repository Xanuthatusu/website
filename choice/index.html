          Choices make up our day to day lives. From the moment you choose to get out of bed to the moment you choose to crawl back in. Sometimes, we're paralyzed by choice. Other times, we exhuast ourselves by trying to list all the benefits and shortcomings of different things, in hope that it will help us make a decision.
        </p>
        <p>
          Everytime we do these things, we are choosing to not make a choice. Whether it's because we want to make the best choice, or we just don't want to be the one to make a decision that nobody else likes.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you can understand and accept that we are making these choices, start paying attention to everytime you make a decision. Everytime you decide to have that soda, or choose to eat unhealthily and justify it by convincing yourself you didn't have the time or you just didn't feel like it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you become aware of the decisions you make everyday, you can start deciding to be better. Diets never seem to work because people try to convince themselves that they can't have something. When was the last time that someone being told they can't do something actually made them discard what they wanted to do?
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want to stop doing something, you need to stop wanting to do that thing. If you want to start doing something, you need to start wanting to do something. If you can convince yourself that you don't want that soda, or you honestly want to take the stairs instead of the elevator, that automatic decision will be made for you, because our primitave monkey brains will always do the thing that we want to do, no matter what we tell ourselves what we can and can't do.
        </p>

          I used to be completely blinded by decisions. I stopped doing the things I loved and wanted to do because I wanted to make sure I was doing them right and getting the most enjoyment out of them. I hadn't picked up one of my favorite video games in months because I had made a mistake on my base and couldn't stand to look at it, but felt like I would be wasting my time if I tried to fix it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I recently opened that same game with the idea of, when I mess up or make a mistake, I will just fix it and try to make it better. I had more fun for a much longer period playing that game again than I have had in a very long time. I believe this is because I wanted to fix my mistakes. I was excited to make mistakes and figure out how to work around them, rather than feeling like I have to fix my mistakes.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you only have the energy to make one major decision every day, choose to be better, the rest will follow.
